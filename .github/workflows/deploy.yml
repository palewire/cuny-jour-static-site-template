# This workflow runs automatically when you create a Release.
#
# HOW TO ENABLE:
# 1. Go to your repository Settings > Pages
# 2. Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
# 3. To deploy, go to your repository's "Releases" page
# 4. Click "Create a new release" (or "Draft a new release")
# 5. Choose a tag (e.g., v1.0.0), add a title, and click "Publish release"
# 6. The workflow will build and deploy your site to https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-repository-name>/
