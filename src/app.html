<!--
  app.html - The HTML Shell Template for SvelteKit
  ================================================
  
  This file is the base HTML template that wraps your entire SvelteKit application.
  Think of it as the "outer shell" that contains all your pages. Every page you 
  create in the routes/ folder will be rendered inside this template.
  
  SvelteKit uses special placeholders that get replaced with your actual content
  when the page is built or served.
  
  This file is loaded ONCE and stays the same across all pages - only the content
  inside %sveltekit.body% changes as you navigate between routes.
